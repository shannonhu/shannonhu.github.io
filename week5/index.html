            I chose Wikipedia as the platform for web intervention. <br>
            As a site that is a collection of shared knowledge, Wikipedia is assumed to be trustworthy when it comes to information sourcing.<br>
            I wanted to do an intervention that questions this assumption. So I created a wiki page for the word"ihlkwjuf".<br>
            It is merely a word that I randomly typed in and it does not have any meaning.<br>
            The page is an intervention addressing the idea that we should be critical when browsing Wikipedia, since the editors can be anyone. 
        </div>
        <img class=img id=img1 src="wiki2.png">
        <img class=img id=img2 src="wiki3.png">
        <img class=img id=img3 src="wiki4.png">
        <div>
            Although it has a warning on the page indicating that this is not a Wikipedia article, I still successfully published the contents.<br>
            And it is now an active <a id=link1 href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:ShannonxHu/sandbox/ihlkwjuf">site</a><br>
            (Not sure when it will be taken down)
